do not use this module
======================

You want https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-unattended_upgrades. No, really.

This is a horribly out-of-date copy of the official module with _awful_ patches to make it minimally compatible with Puppet 3 and _very_ old stdlib.

Don't use it. Look away before your retinas begin to burn.

Trust me.
